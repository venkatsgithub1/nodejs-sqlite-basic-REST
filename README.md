# Node Express REST API beginner project.

## The project helps creation of REST APIs and touches all CRUD functionalities.

## SQLite is used as DB, in order to store some famous quotes in Computer Science domain.

## Packages:

- better-sqlite3
- express

## ESLint is used to check for any linting errors.

### The project helped me code different endpoints to create, read, update and delete the data from DB, how to use path parameters with express, how to mount a route middleware.

#### Thanks to this [Blog Post](https://geshan.com.np/blog/2021/10/nodejs-sqlite/#sqlite-and-node.js) by [@geshan](https://github.com/geshan)

#### Recommendation, use thunderclient in vscode to test APIs, its pretty cool.
